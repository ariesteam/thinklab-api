This project defines the official Thinklab API as a set of documented Java interfaces. Any 
implementation of the Thinklab semantic modeling platform must implement it. The reference 
implementation is the thinklab project, which will be made compliant before release 1.0.

The API only refers to the runtime side and does not mandate any language conventions for the
language that defines the modeling objects. It does, however, specify what those objects should
do and how they should be known to thinklab. All model objects are expected to have a source code
counterpart. The thinklab project implements a full clojure-based modeling language. The language
parser should eventually become a separate projects from thinklab and use a plug-in factory to 
create the model objects.

The files in doc/ constitute some basic documentation of the concepts and language elements in
thinklab. They are written in textile markup language.

Along with the API, the library provides a minimum number of support classes that implement
standard exceptions, basic language elements such as quantifiers and connectors, and minimal 
storage structures such as pairs and triples. This library is intended to be standalone and 
have no dependencies other than a Java 1.5+ runtime.
